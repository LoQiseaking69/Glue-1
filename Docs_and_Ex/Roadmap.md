# Updated GLUE Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Initial Development
- Focus on integrating Norse runes and Hehner's Algebra into the GLUE language, targeting robotics and AI.
- Develop core syntax and grammar, combining elements of Julia and Scala, and align with Rustâ€™s ecosystem.
- Plan advanced features for unsupervised evolutionary computation in robotics.

## Phase 2: Building Foundations
- Establish the Rust-based development environment.
- Start developing the lexer, parser, and initial version of the compiler/interpreter.
- Lay groundwork for the GLUE standard library, focusing on robotics and deep learning.

## Phase 3: Language Advancement
- Enhance syntax and parsing, incorporating unique GLUE elements.
- Integrate advanced features like concurrency and memory safety.
- Work on compiler optimization and efficiency.

## Phase 4: Standard Library Expansion
- Expand the standard library with modules for specific robotics applications.
- Develop tools for debugging and testing GLUE code.
- Ensure compatibility and integration with Rust's ecosystem.

## Phase 5: Refinement and Testing
- Rigorous testing and iteration based on feedback.
- Engage with the robotics community for insights and improvements.
- Optimize for performance and usability.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Community
- Create comprehensive documentation and user guides.
- Foster a GLUE user community, promoting collaboration and feedback.
- Encourage contributions to enhance the language's ecosystem.

## Phase 7: Launch and Feedback Integration
- Officially release GLUE with emphasis on its unique features.
- Continuously update the language based on user feedback and needs.
- Expand the ecosystem with tools and libraries for a broader application range.

## Phase 8: Sustained Development and Outreach
- Provide ongoing support and adapt to technological advancements.
- Grow the user and developer community, maintaining relevance in robotics and AI.
- Seek collaborations to broaden GLUE's scope and impact.
