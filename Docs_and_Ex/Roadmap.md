# GLUE Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning and Design
- Define core language philosophy and goals, drawing from principles of simplicity and universality.
- Craft a minimalistic yet expressive syntax, utilizing a combination of Norse runes and Greek characters for symbolic representation.
- Establish fundamental grammar rules and compiler requirements, ensuring compatibility with Rust's infrastructure.
- Plan integration of key robotics and AI functionalities into the standard library, focusing on efficiency and versatility.
- Incorporate principles from Hehner's Unified Algebra Framework for efficient mathematical computation.

## Phase 2: Development Setup
- Set up development environment and toolchain, optimizing for seamless collaboration.
- Kickstart Rust-based backend development, laying the groundwork for GLUE's interpreter and compiler.
- Create initial version of the GLUE compiler/interpreter, leveraging Rust's robustness and performance.
- Begin building the GLUE standard library with dedicated modules for robotics and AI applications.

## Phase 3: Language Development
- Implement basic syntax and parsing functionalities, refining the symbolic representations for clarity and coherence.
- Integrate Rust's memory safety and concurrency features, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- Develop cryptic language elements and structures, blending Norse runes and Greek characters to enhance comprehensibility.
- Enhance the compiler with optimization techniques to improve efficiency and performance.

## Phase 4: Standard Library and Tools
- Expand the standard library with additional modules tailored to robotics-specific requirements.
- Create debugging and testing tools specifically designed for GLUE, facilitating development and debugging processes.
- Seamlessly integrate GLUE with Rust's ecosystem, enabling interoperability with existing libraries and tools.

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- Conduct rigorous testing of language features and compiler functionality, iterating based on test results and user feedback.
- Solicit feedback from early users and robotics experts to identify areas for improvement.
- Refine language design and implementation, prioritizing simplicity and crypticity while addressing user needs.
- Optimize performance and resource management to ensure efficient execution on resource-constrained devices.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Community Building
- Develop comprehensive documentation, providing detailed explanations of language features and usage guidelines.
- Create tutorials and guides to onboard new users and facilitate their understanding of GLUE's unique syntax and semantics.
- Establish a community platform for GLUE users to exchange ideas, share experiences, and collaborate on projects.
- Encourage community contributions and feedback to foster a vibrant and inclusive development ecosystem.

## Phase 7: Release and Expansion
