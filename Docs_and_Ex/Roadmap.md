# GLUE Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning and Design
- Define core language philosophy and goals.
- Design minimalistic yet cryptic syntax.
- Establish basic grammar and compiler requirements.
- Plan integration with Rust's infrastructure.
- Identify key robotics and AI functionalities for the standard library.

## Phase 2: Development Setup
- Set up development environment and toolchain.
- Initiate Rust-based backend development.
- Develop initial version of the GLUE compiler/interpreter.
- Start creating the GLUE standard library focusing on robotics and AI.

## Phase 3: Language Development
- Implement basic syntax and parsing functionalities.
- Integrate Rust's memory safety and concurrency features.
- Develop cryptic language elements and structures.
- Enhance the compiler with optimization techniques.

## Phase 4: Standard Library and Tools
- Expand the standard library with robotics-specific modules.
- Develop debugging and testing tools for GLUE.
- Integrate GLUE with Rust's ecosystem (libraries and tools).

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- Conduct thorough testing of language features and compiler.
- Collect feedback from initial users and robotics experts.
- Refine language based on feedback, focusing on simplicity and crypticity.
- Optimize performance and resource management.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Community Building
- Create comprehensive documentation, unraveling cryptic aspects.
- Develop tutorials and guides for new users.
- Establish a community platform for GLUE users.
- Encourage community contributions and feedback.

## Phase 7: Release and Expansion
- Officially launch the first stable version of GLUE.
- Monitor user adoption and gather feedback.
- Plan and implement additional features and optimizations.
- Expand the ecosystem with more tools and libraries.

## Phase 8: Long-Term Support and Growth
- Ensure continuous support and updates for GLUE.
- Adapt to evolving robotics and AI technologies.
- Foster a vibrant community for ongoing development.
- Explore partnerships and collaborations in robotics and AI fields.
