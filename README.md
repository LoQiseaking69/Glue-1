# GLUE: Genetic Language for Unsupervised Evolution in Robotics

![GLUE Language Concept](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/Glue/blob/main/misc/SephsLang.PNG)

## Overview
GLUE is a Rust-based programming language that distinctively integrates Norse runes, Hehner's Unified Algebra notation, and advanced programming paradigms with a focus on robotics. Its innovative syntax merges elements of Julia, Scala, and functional programming, making it particularly suited for unsupervised evolutionary computation in robotic systems.

### Key Syntax Features
- **Norse Runes Integration**: Implements ancient runes to enable concise yet powerful expressions, contributing to both the succinctness and expressiveness of the language.
- **Hehner's Algebra Notation**: Incorporates elegant algebraic symbols, streamlining complex mathematical operations in programming.
- **Julia & Scala Inspired Syntax**: The language design draws inspiration from Julia and Scala, offering a familiar but innovative coding experience that combines the best of both worlds.

## Core Components

### Standard Library
GLUE's standard library is robust and tailored for applications in robotics, genetics, and deep learning. It leverages an intuitive Norse rune-based syntax along with sophisticated module management, which is particularly effective for AI and genetic algorithm implementations.

### Compiler/Interpreter
The GLUE compiler and interpreter are designed to efficiently process and compile GLUE code. They blend the distinct elements of runes and algebraic symbols with modern language constructs, resulting in executable machine code. This system supports concurrency and incorporates advanced language features, showcasing the versatility and power of GLUE.

### Lexer
The lexer for GLUE is an enhanced lexical analyzer capable of effectively parsing the unique elements of the language. It handles the intricacies of Norse runes, algebraic functions, and complex language constructs, ensuring accurate and efficient tokenization.

### Parser
GLUEâ€™s parser transforms code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It is adept at interpreting the intricate interplay of runes, algebra, and modern syntax, playing a critical role in understanding and processing the language structure.

GLUE represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous robotics, merging the rich heritage of ancient symbols with cutting-edge computational techniques. With its unique syntax and powerful toolset, GLUE empowers robotic systems to learn, adapt, and evolve autonomously, opening new frontiers in robotics research and application.
