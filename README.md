# GLUE: Genetic Language for Unsupervised Evolution

![seph writing his soul](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/Glue/blob/main/SephsLang.PNG)

## Overview
GLUE is a specialized programming language built on Rust, tailored as a device-hosted runtime to serve as the foundational framework for integrating genetic algorithms with deep learning in robotics. This language aims to be the core component, the 'glue' that binds together evolutionary algorithms and machine learning models, facilitating unsupervised learning and continuous adaptation in robotic systems.

**Note:** GLUE's innovative approach involves leveraging Hehner's Unified Algebra alongside genetic algorithms and deep learning architectures. This enables adaptive and continuous improvement within the language's runtime, enhancing efficiency and expressiveness across all components.

## Components

### Standard Library
Here lies a robust set of libraries offering out-of-the-box functionalities for common tasks in robotics, genetic algorithms, and deep learning operations.

### Compiler or Interpreter
The engine that translates GLUE code into executable instructions, this component is the powerhouse of the language, encompassing lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis alongside code generation.

### Runtime Environment
This includes the necessary tools and protocols for the execution of GLUE programs, managing resources, interfacing with hardware, and ensuring smooth operation in real-time.

GLUE is more than just a programming language; it is a step towards the future of autonomous robotics, where machines can learn, adapt, and evolve independently in complex environments, powered by the unified algebraic principles of Hehner's Unified Algebra.
