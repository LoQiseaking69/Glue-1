# GLUE: Genetic Language for Unsupervised Evolution in Robotics

![GLUE Language Concept](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/Glue/blob/main/SephsLang.PNG)

## Overview
GLUE, a Rust-based programming language, uniquely combines Norse runes and Hehner's Unified Algebra notation, targeting robotics. Its syntax is a harmonious blend of Julia and Scala aesthetics, optimized for unsupervised evolutionary computation in robotic systems.

### Key Syntax Features
- **Norse Runes Integration**: Utilizes ancient runes for concise, powerful expressions.
- **Hehner's Algebra Notation**: Adopts algebraic symbols for elegant mathematical operations.
- **Julia & Scala Inspired Syntax**: Offers a familiar yet innovative coding experience.

## Core Components

### Standard Library
Robust library tailored for robotics, genetics, and deep learning, with intuitive Norse rune-based syntax:
```julia
rune ᚠᚢᚦ: SensorData
ᚠᚢᚦ(ᚱᛟᛒᛟᛏ) -> ᚠᚢᚦᚲᚢᚱᚱᛖᚾᛏ
```

### Compiler/Interpreter
Efficiently compiles GLUE code, blending runes and algebraic symbols into executable machine code:
```scala
trait GlueCompiler {
  def ᚱᚢᚾᛖᚲᚢᛗᛈᛁᛚᛖ(sourceCode: String): Executable
}
```

### Runtime Environment
Optimized for real-time robotic operations, interpreting rune-based commands with precision:
```rust
fn execute_rune_code(code: RuneCode) {
    match code {
        Rune::ᚠᚢᚦ => execute_sensor_operations(),
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Lexer
Enhanced lexical analyzer for GLUE, including support for runes, algebraic functions, and other unique features:
```rust
use regex::Regex;
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

GLUE is a revolutionary step in autonomous robotics, bringing ancient wisdom and modern computation into a seamless blend. Its unique syntax and powerful standard library are at the forefront of enabling robots to learn, adapt, and evolve independently.
