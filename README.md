# GLUE: Genetic Language for Unsupervised Evolution in Robotics

![GLUE Language Concept](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/Glue/blob/main/misc/SephsLang.PNG)

## Overview
GLUE, a Rust-based programming language, uniquely combines Norse runes, Hehner's Unified Algebra notation, and advanced programming paradigms, targeting robotics. Its syntax is a harmonious blend of Julia, Scala, and functional programming aesthetics, optimized for unsupervised evolutionary computation in robotic systems.

### Key Syntax Features
- **Norse Runes Integration**: Utilizes ancient runes for concise, powerful expressions.
- **Hehner's Algebra Notation**: Adopts algebraic symbols for elegant mathematical operations.
- **Julia & Scala Inspired Syntax**: Offers a familiar yet innovative coding experience.

## Core Components

### Standard Library
A robust library tailored for robotics, genetics, and deep learning, with intuitive Norse rune-based syntax and sophisticated module management for AI and genetic algorithms.
```rust
pub struct StdLib {
    // Sophisticated module management for robotics and AI
    modules: std::sync::RwLock<std::collections::HashMap<std::any::TypeId, std::sync::Arc<dyn Module>>>,
    // Example Norse rune-based function
    pub fn rune_function(&self, robot: Robot) -> Signal {
        // Norse runes and algebraic operations
        self.get_module::<RobotModule>().map(|mod| mod.perform_action(robot))
    }
}
```

### Compiler/Interpreter
Efficiently compiles GLUE code, blending runes, algebraic symbols, and modern language constructs into executable machine code, supporting concurrency and advanced language features.
```rust
trait GlueCompiler {
  // Method to compile rune and algebra-based GLUE code
  def runeCompile(sourceCode: String): Executable = {
    // Compilation logic leveraging advanced features
  }
  // Additional compilation methods for handling complex language constructs
}
```

### Lexer
An enhanced lexical analyzer for GLUE, capable of parsing runes, algebraic functions, and complex language constructs.
```rust
use regex::Regex;
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct Lexer {
    // Lexer implementation for handling Norse runes and algebra
    token_patterns: HashMap<String, Regex>,
    // Method to tokenize GLUE code
    fn lex(&self, input: &str) -> Vec<Token> {
        // Lexing logic...
    }
}
```

### Parser
A sophisticated parser that transforms GLUE code into an abstract syntax tree, understanding the interplay of runes, algebra, and modern syntax.
```rust
struct Parser {
    // Parser implementation...
    fn parse(&self, tokens: Vec<Token>) -> AST {
        // Parsing logic to handle runes and Hehner's algebra
    }
}
```

GLUE is a revolutionary step in autonomous robotics, blending ancient wisdom with modern computational techniques. Its unique syntax, powerful standard library, and sophisticated compilation and analysis tools enable robots to learn, adapt, and evolve independently.
