![GLUE Language Concept](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/Glue/blob/main/misc/SephsLang.PNG)

## Overview
[GLUE (Genetic Language for Unsupervised Evolution)](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/Glue/discussions/6) is a Rust-based programming language tailored for advanced robotics applications. It integrates Norse runes with Hehner's Unified Algebra notation, enabling a powerful and expressive language optimized for unsupervised evolutionary computation in robotics.

### Unique Syntax
GLUE‚Äôs syntax features a blend of historical and contemporary elements:
- **Norse Runes Integration**: Utilizes ancient symbols for compact and expressive commands, ideal for controlling complex robotic systems.
- **Hehner's Algebra Notation**: Employs a mathematical notation for precise operations, streamlining the expression of computational logic.
- **Influences from Julia & Scala**: Incorporates elements from these modern languages, creating an intuitive and powerful programming experience.

## Core Components

### Standard Library
The GLUE Standard Library, discussed in detail [here](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/Glue/discussions/7), is designed for applications in robotics, genetics, and deep learning. It features modules and functions optimized for AI and genetic algorithms, using rune-based syntax and algebraic expressions to simplify complex tasks.

### Compiler/Interpreter
The GLUE compiler and interpreter adeptly translate the unique syntax of GLUE code into efficient machine code. They are engineered to support advanced features such as concurrency, highlighting the language's robustness and adaptability.

### Lexer
The Lexer plays a crucial role in parsing GLUE's unique syntax. It accurately identifies and processes runes and algebraic symbols, ensuring precise tokenization before the compilation process.

### Parser
The Parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the Lexer. It interprets the significance of each rune and algebraic symbol, effectively integrating them with traditional programming constructs.

## GLUE Code Example
Below is an example of GLUE code that illustrates the language's unique syntax and capabilities:

```
    ìÉÄ Example of GLUE code
    ·ö†2 ‚äï x ‚äó ·ö¢·õã4 ‚äñ 7·õã‚úµ if ·ö† ‚â° ·ö¢ { channelFehu() } ‚Ü¨ { maintainRuneBalance() }
    let greeting = "Hello, ·ö†·ö¢·ö¶ World!"
    ·ö®·ö±·ö∑(·õè·õñ·õó·õà·õö·ö±·ö¢·öæ·õñ) -> ·ö†·ö¢·ö¶·ö≤·ö¢·ö±·ö±·õñ·öæ·õè
```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of runes for operations and data types, Hehner's algebra for mathematical operations, and the incorporation of traditional programming constructs for variable assignments and control structures. Together, these elements form the foundation of GLUE's syntax, facilitating powerful and expressive programming for robotic systems.

We invite the community of developers, roboticists, and enthusiasts to collaborate on the development of GLUE, contributing to the evolution of autonomous robotics.
